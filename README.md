This is a Hassio addon to monitor [voltronic axpert inverters](http://www.voltronicpower.com/oCart2/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=123) through USB and publish the data as JSON to an MQTT broker. It publishes the data to 3 topics:

- 'power/axpert' for the parallel data (some of these values seem to be only for the connected inverter even though they are returned by the parallel data command)
- 'power/axpert_settings' for the configured settings
- 'power/axpert{sn}' for the data from the connected inverter (configurable, {sn} is replaced with the serial number of the inverter)

You can then configure the sensors in Home Assistant like this:

```
sensors:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Power"
    state_topic: "power/axpert"
    unit_of_measurement: 'W'
    value_template: "{{ value_json.TotalAcOutputActivePower }}"
    expire_after: 60
```

The values published on 'power/axpert' are:
- SerialNumber # of the first inverter in the parallel setup
- TotalAcOutputActivePower
- TotalAcOutputApparentPower
- TotalAcOutputPercentage
- BatteryChargingCurrent
- BatteryDischargeCurrent
- TotalChargingCurrent
- GridVoltage
- GridFrequency
- OutputVoltage
- OutputFrequency
- OutputAparentPower
- OutputActivePower
- LoadPercentage
- BatteryVoltage
- BatteryCapacity
- PvInputVoltage
- OutputMode
- ChargerSourcePriority
- MaxChargeCurrent
- MaxChargerRange
- MaxAcChargerCurrent
- PvInputCurrentForBattery
- Gridmode
- Solarmode

The values published on 'power/axpert_settings' are:
- AcInputVoltage
- AcInputCurrent
- AcOutputVoltage
- AcOutputFrequency

- AcOutputApparentPower
- AcOutputActivePower
- BatteryVoltage
- BatteryRechargeVoltage
- BatteryUnderVoltage

- InputVoltageRange
- OutputSourcePriority
- ChargerSourcePriority
- MaxParallelUnits
- MachineType
- Topology
- OutputMode
- BatteryRedischargeVoltage
- PvOkCondition
- PvPowerBalance
- MaxBatteryCvChargingTime

The values published on 'power/axpert{sn}' are:
- BusVoltage
- InverterHeatsinkTemperature
- BatteryVoltageFromScc
- PvInputCurrent
- PvInputVoltage
- PvInputPower
- BatteryChargingCurrent
- BatteryDischargeCurrent
- DeviceStatus

I have 3 inverters in parallel and a raspberry connected to 1 of them with a USB cable . Linux doesn't seem to recognize it as a USB to Serial device and it only shows up as `/dev/hidraw0`.

A description of the serial communication protocol can be found [here](file:///home/freon/Downloads/HS_MS_MSX-Communication%20Protocol-NEW.pdf)

## Install

Add https://github.com/MindFreeze/home-assistant-addons to the addon store repositories and you will get a Axpert Inverter listed there.
Note that this assumes the inverter is `/dev/hidraw0`. If you have other USB to Serial devices connected this might be wrong.
